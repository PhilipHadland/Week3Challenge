# Week3Challenge

- What was the challenge?
Create a program which will print numbers out in character form, for example 156 would print as one hundred and fifty six.

- How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the challange to go well.

- What went well?
It was fun to think through the logic because there are many different ways to approach the challenge.

- What didn't go as planned?
Everything went as planned however I think next time I could've created more methods to do different parts of the task, instead I've got the same code written multiple times in different places whereas I could've just created a method and called that method when required.

- Possible improvements for future challenges
Create more methods to clean up the code which will make it easier to read and follow along.
